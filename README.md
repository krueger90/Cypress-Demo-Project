# Cypress-Demo-Project

## Intro

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilities in framework setup, test writing and implementation using Cypress and TypeScript. The tests will focus on automating various scenarios on a dummy SUT (a third party website specially created for this purpose), with both BDD and spec style approach. Please keep in mind that this is an ongoing project and new test and functionalities will be added constantly.

## Pre-requirements

I used versions **v20.10.0** and **10.2.3** of Node.js and npm respectively. The Cypress minimum requirement for Node.js is **18.x**. You can use the same or later versions.

## Installation

   Run `npm install` to install dev dependencies.

## Tests

   Run `npm run cypress:open` if you want to bring up the GUI and select yourself what tests to execute, or, run `npm run cypress:run-local`, to run the tests in headless mode and to generate a report.
