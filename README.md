# Cypress-Demo-Project

# Intro

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilities in framework setup, test writing and implementation using Cypress and TypeScript. The tests will focus on automating various scenarios on a dummy SUT (a third party website specially created for this purpose), with both BDD and spec style approach. Please keep in mind that this is an ongoing project and new test and functionalities will be added constantly.
